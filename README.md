# Translate-Me

Working with Co-founder of TranslateMe Ryan Llyod to create language translation
(like GOOGLE) that support on multiGPU system (presently working on Lua). Neural
Machine translation is the latest in translation. This existing model works very well
but it depends heavily on data to be fed into the system. This Project is live and
hosted on the URL: http://139.59.34.103:3000/
presently working on one million dataset (ENGLISH TO FRENCH)

• Human real-time input will be rewarded in tokens, this will form a basic working
relationship between the platform and contributors.
The Problem
Translation projects around the world are racing to build the best solution and centralize the service. Holding ransom to the technology and charging the end user excessively. Each platform investing in one entity and not sharing the resources to make a better solution for all.
The Solution
TranslateMe reduces costs with blockchain and builds a ecosystem for all that’s built by all, this means all contributions are pooled to a single point of success and the efforts are not divided but united. Distribution of work and wealth the way it should be.

1.Neural Machine Translation
Neural Machine translation is the latest in translation. This existing model works very well but it depends heavily on data to be fed into the system.

2.Human Input
Human real-time input will be rewarded in tokens, this will form a basic working relationship between the platform and contributors.

3.Advanced API
The API will be crucial for third party integration and human input. Our API will plugin into any platform that requires real time translation.

4.Distributed Computing
Decentralised network costs less and is highly secure. Distributed computing for server-side computation and translation requests

5.Token Reward Mining Algorithm
The reward for this work done will remain with a mining algorithm that will pay the user for their support of the network and their contribution to evolving neural machine translation.

6.Blockchain Savings
The translation industry is worth an estimated 44 billion dollars year, with the cost of translation being so high currently many innovators and solutions in the market that integrate translation have to fit a large bill.
 bill.
